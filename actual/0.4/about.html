		<h2>What I do</h2>
		<p>As I learn web technologies, concepts and languages throughout my studies, I try to test my skills during school projects and external projects, on my own or with friends.</p>
		<p>On this website, I try to collect everything I do on the Internet and document my learning on my blog. I am dedicated to my work and I love what I do, and I want to share that with the world.</p>
